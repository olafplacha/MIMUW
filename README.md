## Second year
### Databases
#### Flights search engine with tickets management system

The web application lets users search for flights based on their cost preferences. By setting a large time-value coefficient, the user is shown a fast connection, where total price is not of great importance. On the other hand, setting a small time-value coefficient, the user is shown the cheapest connection, but not necessarily the fastest one. Users can also register and manage their tickets.
Moreover, the application lets airlines register, add new airplanes to their fleets and manage their flights.

Under the hood a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm is used. You can see my implementation [a relative link](Second_Year/Databases/Projects/algorithms/dijkstra.py)
